I recently developed a dual-version front-end website showcasing different approaches to AI prompt generation interfaces. While this was created as part of my application for an AI Prompt Generator position, I'm proud to share it as it demonstrates my passion for creating engaging user experiences and interactive web interfaces.

🔍 What I built:
• Two distinct versions of an interactive website
• Modern, responsive design with smooth animations
• Clean, intuitive user interface
• Cross-browser compatible implementation

💡 Key features:
• Interactive user interface elements
• Responsive design principles
• Modern CSS animations
• Clean and intuitive layout

🛠️ Technologies used:
• HTML5
• CSS3
• JavaScript
• Modern web design principles

While the application wasn't successful, I believe in sharing both successes and learning experiences. This project represents my commitment to continuous learning and my ability to create engaging web interfaces.
